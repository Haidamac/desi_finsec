# Software to evaluate the effect of digitalization on the financial security of the corporate sector

The software uses scripts in the statistical programming language R (version 4.4.2) with the packages:
• lmtest - for testing diagnostic hypotheses
• sandwich - for calculating robust standard errors
• MASS - for robust M-estimation
• quantreg - for quantile regression
• plm - for panel models
• ggplot2 - for visualizing results
For the specification of the Bayesian model, the brms package was used, which provides an interface to Stan - a platform for Bayesian probabilistic programming.
